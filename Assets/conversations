15|1|16|Ask the driver where the bus is headed. 
15|2|18|Try to talk to the driver, but forget how to English instead.
15|3|3|Moon the bus. 

16|0||The bus driver lifts her head and says, in a scratchy voice, "Henderson". 
16|1|17|Nope. (Run)
16|2|17|Nope nope nope. (Run faster)	
16|3||Get on the bus (are you even reading this?)

17|0||Undead Hendersonians poor out of the bus. Teeth gnashing, claws flying they seek your blood. A blue jeaned, black t-shirted horde of death. What do you do?

17|3||*Dive into a nearby psychiatrist office.*

24|3||Turbo bro-fist yolo! 

25|0||I'm just glad to be in anything.
25|1||That's what your mum said. 
25|2||I must go, my people need me. *flight boots*
25|3||Thats just sad, bro. 

26|0||Look, Donna, I thought that maybe we could get past this restraining order thing. I love you.
26|1||Leave. Now. 
26|2||The police are on their way.

1015|3||wow.

30|0||Hey, Liz. Did you ever finish making that game? 
30|1|31|Too many gui problems, too many haters.  
30|2|32|I quit that shit months ago Beth. 
30|3|33|Problems Beth, known unknowns and unknown unknowns. You know. 

31|0||Gui's can be tough. Weren't you going for a space theme? 
31|1|34|Space Western. 
31|2|35|More DS9 than BSG. 
31|3||What? No. That was the last game. This one's set in Vichy France, so it's kinda faux-nazi-punk, but less offensive.

34|0||Adios, space cowgirl. I loved Cowboy Bebop.
34|1|37|I know right. That show still feels fresh after what, nearly 20 years? 
34|2||Urgh, no. Everyone I tell about this either thinks it's a riff on bebop or Firefly.
34|3||Ein's theme tune plays when you hover over the map. 

37|0||I don't think I'll watch Space Dandy, I get that those fake tits are meant to be satirical but it still feels cheap. 
37|1||You're over thinking it. The show is called Space Dandy, the main dude is worse than the bimbo's. Faye had fake tit's and she was great. 
37|1||It grosses me out, I get that it's part of the trope too, but you know, why bother? 
37|3||I don't care. The characters are surprising and the plots engaging. 

32|0||And you've been doing what? Playing Skyrim? Trying to steal the neighbor's cat for three months? 
32|1||You leave Skampy Fluffy Face out of this. 
32|2|40| I'm doing things, I just need this time Beth. 
32|3|41|Yes I play Skyrim. No I will not stop. I am the Dovakin. *Fus*

40|0||You can't pay your rent in Iron Daggers Liz. 
40|1||What about Elven Daggers? 70g a pop!
40|2||Things will change soon, I can feel it. 
40|3|| *FUS RO DAH*

41|0||Dova-wa?
41|1||*RO DAH*
41|2||*RO DAH*
41|3||*RO DAH*

33|0||Stop your doublespeak Aes Sedai scum. 
33|1||That's Boondocks, not series that never ends and then did end badly. 
33|2||Known unknowns and unknown unknowns. It's not hard to follow.
33|3||Hey Beth, the next statement is true. The previous statement is false. 

35|0||The Sisko was a rip of The Sheridan.  
35|1||You shut your damn mouth. Sisko saved The Prophet's! Ok, I will be quiet now. 
35|2||There is nothing new under the sun, read your ecclesiastes.
35|3||More beer than wine, seriously do we have any wine?

50|0||Hello, what seems to be the problem? It’s been a while since your last checkup.
50|1|51|I’m getting hairier. I think I might be a werewolf.
50|2|52|I keep getting these headaches…
50|3|53|Is my leg supposed to bend like this?

51|0||Can I have a hair sample, please? I’ll need to do some tests, but I’m fairly sure you’re nuts.
51|1||I want a second opinion! Goodbye!
51|2||Well that all sounds reasonable, I… wait a second.
51|3||I guess the thing that bit me was just a really hairy mugger.

52|0||Have you been in an accident lately? You might be concussed.
52|1||I don’t remember. Is that bad, doctor?
52|2||Well, I was driving my car on a golf course. After that it gets kind of hazy…
52|3||No, but I have been listening to a lot of prog-industrial grindcore death thrash bands.

53|0||Oh my God you need to get to a hospital. I’m just an optometrist!
53|1||Urrgh.
53|2||Hurrghglglllffff.
53|3||Well, I could use a new pair of glasses while I’m here.

54|0||Hey, I’d like to order a large pizza, half pepperoni, half mushroom and onion.
54|1||You’ve got the wrong number. Goodbye.
54|2|55|Sure, do you want that pick up or delivery?
54|3|56|That’s all very well, but what does the pizza *mean*?

55|0||Uh can you deliver that, please? I should be in the database, I eat an ungodly amount of pizza.
55|1|57|Sure, we can deliver. That’ll be $19.50 please.
55|2||I’ll tell you what, I’ll forget this conversation ever happened if you do. This isn’t a pizzeria.
55|3|56|First, I need you to convince me that you NEED this pizza.

56|0||Pizza is a metaphor. It represents palimpsest, the layering of ingredients and toppings over an unchanging, eternal base. In its greasiness, pizza is analogous to the slippery, ever-changing nature of meaning and identity.
56|1|58|I disagree. I think the mass-produced pizza is an endemic icon of total nihilism, a pale shadow of its own lack of coherence.
56|2||Buh?
56|3||Well, that was a surprisingly articulate response.

57|0||Cool. Thanks. *Click*
57|1||Ahh. Back to my thoughts.
57|2||What an idiot. I’m not running a pizza place.
57|3||Wait, maybe I AM a pizzeria. I should probably make this pie.

58|0||I was just kidding. It’s pizza.
58|1||Uh, so was I. Ha. Ha. Okayhangingupnowgoodbye.
58|2||Have you read Zizek on pizza? It’s quite pertinent to this discussion. Hey, where’d you go?
58|3||Guess what else? You’ve got the wrong number. Now who’s smart, sucker!?
